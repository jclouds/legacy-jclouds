    * the subsequent request.
    * <p/>
    * Note that the value of NextMarker should be treated as opaque.
    * <p/>
    * The delimiter parameter enables the caller to traverse the blob keyspace by using a
    * user-configured delimiter. The delimiter may be a single character or a string. When the
    * request includes this parameter, the operation returns a BlobPrefix element. The BlobPrefix
    * element is returned in place of all blobs whose keys begin with the same substring up to the
    * appearance of the delimiter character. The value of the BlobPrefix element is
    * substring+delimiter, where substring is the common substring that begins one or more blob
    * keys, and delimiter is the value of the delimiter parameter.
    * <p/>
    * You can use the value of BlobPrefix to make a subsequent call to list the blobs that begin
    * with this prefix, by specifying the value of BlobPrefix for the prefix parameter on the
    * request URI. In this way, you can traverse a virtual hierarchy of blobs as though it were a
    * file system.
    * <p/>
    * Note that each BlobPrefix element returned counts toward the maximum result, just as each Blob
    * element does.
