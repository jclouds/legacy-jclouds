    * Imports the public key from an RSA key pair that you created with a third-party tool. Compare
    * this with CreateKeyPair, in which AWS creates the key pair and gives the keys to you (AWS
    * keeps a copy of the public key). With ImportKeyPair, you create the key pair and give AWS just
    * the public key. The private key is never transferred between you and AWS.
    * 
    * <p/>
    * You can easily create an RSA key pair on Windows and Linux using the ssh-keygen command line
    * tool (provided with the standard OpenSSH installation). Standard library support for RSA key
    * pair creation is also available in Java, Ruby, Python, and many other programming languages.

    * <h4>Supported Formats</h4>
    * <ul>
    * <li>OpenSSH public key format (e.g., the format in ~/.ssh/authorized_keys)</li>
    * <li>Base64 encoded DER format</li>
    * <li>SSH public key file format as specified in RFC4716</li>
    * </ul>
    * DSA keys are not supported. Make sure your key generator is set up to create RSA keys.
    * <p/>
    * Supported lengths: 1024, 2048, and 4096.
