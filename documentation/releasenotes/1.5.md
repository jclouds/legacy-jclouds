Release Notes for jclouds Version 1.5
=========================

## Introduction

The release of jclouds Version 1.5 is the result of a collaboration between the jclouds team and our contributors. There are some notable
updates in Version 1.5 that our users have been requesting.  It is recommended that you upgrade to jclouds Version 1.5 if you are
still using jclouds Version 1.4.

A total of [46 Issues](http://code.google.com/p/jclouds/issues/list?can=1&q=label%3AMilestone%3A1.5.0%2C1.5.0+status%3AFixed&colspec=ID+Type+Status+Priority+Milestone+Owner+Summary&cells=tiles)
were addressed between jclouds Version 1.4 and the current iteration of jclouds Version 1.5.

## Cool Stuff in this Release

Massive new support for OpenStack based clouds.

## Notable Updates in jclouds Version 1.5 

*  Introduced support for the current release of [OpenStack](http://openstack.org/) (Essex) utilizing the new openstack-keystone, openstack-nova, 
openstack-glance, openstack-quantum, and openstack-nova-ec2 providers
*  Introduced support for using the free [TryStack](https://trystack.org/) cloud utilizing the trystack-nova provider
*  Introduced support for [GreenQloud](http://greenqloud.com/) utilizing the qreenqloud-compute and greenqloud-storage providers
*  Introduced support for [Joyent Cloud](http://www.joyentcloud.com/) utilizing the joyentcloud provider
*  Introduced NodePool for the pooling and reuse of nodes
*  Introduced new [OpenShift](https://openshift.redhat.com/app/), [Cloud Foundry](http://www.cloudfoundry.com/), and [Heroku](http://www.heroku.com/) 
environments to the [TweetStore](https://github.com/jclouds/jclouds/tree/master/demos/tweetstore) demo 
*  Introduced a refreshed [Google App Engine demo](https://github.com/jclouds/jclouds/tree/master/demos/googleappengine) which works on OpenStack
*  Introduced [TemplateBuilderSpec](http://code.google.com/p/jclouds/issues/detail?id=938&can=1&sort=-id) to simplify creating templates for use in
the ComputeService
*  Introduced image support to [go grid](http://code.google.com/p/jclouds/issues/detail?id=851)
*  Introduced [Provider/ApiMetadata](http://code.google.com/p/jclouds/issues/detail?id=657&can=1&sort=-id&start=300) to get 
metadata associated with the provider or API being used internally in jclouds
*  Introduced the jclouds image extension to create and modify images based on nodes
*  Introduced support for [CloudStack](http://cloudstack.org/) Version 3.0
*  Introduced new naming conventions for functions controlling servers.  These functions were formerly in a class with the naming convention FunctionClient.
This led to confusion, so naming conventions will now end in Api.  For example, if the class was formerly named ServerClient, it will now be called ServerApi.
*  Enhanced [CloudWatch](http://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/) support
*  Enhanced the way that OSGi bundles are generated for jclouds so that they are cleaner

## New Features to Watch in Labs

*  Development for [Rackspace Cloud NextGen](http://www.rackspace.com/cloud/nextgen/) utilizing the rackspace-cloudserver-us provider
*  Development for [vCloud Director 1.5](http://code.google.com/p/jclouds/issues/detail?id=830) utilizing the vcloud-director provider
*  Development for [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) utilizing the virtualbox provider

Disclaimer:  These features are currently being developed and evaluated by our team and contributors.  We cannot guarantee forwards and backwards
compatibility for these features.

## Deprecated Components and Non-backwards Compatible Changes

*  Removed the hpcloud-objectstorage-lvs provider.  This has been replaced with the hpcloud-objectstorage provider.
*  Replaced the class called ModifyRequest for users creating their own jclouds drivers.  The replacement for this class is HttpRequest.Builder.  This can 
be created from an existing request via request.toBuilder().
