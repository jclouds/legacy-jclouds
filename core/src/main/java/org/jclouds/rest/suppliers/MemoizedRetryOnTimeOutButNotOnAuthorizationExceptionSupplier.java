 * A shared exception reference is used so that anyone who encounters an authorizationexception will
 * be short-circuited. This prevents accounts from being locked out.

 * http://code.google.com/p/google-guice/issues/detail?id=483 guice doesn't remember when singleton
 * providers throw exceptions. in this case, if the supplier fails with an authorization exception,
 * it is called again for each provider method that depends on it. To short-circuit this, we
 * remember the last exception trusting that guice is single-threaded.
