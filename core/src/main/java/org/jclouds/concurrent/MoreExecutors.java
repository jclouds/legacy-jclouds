   /**
    * Taken from @link com.google.common.util.concurrent.MoreExecutors} as it was hidden and
    * therefore incapable of instanceof checks.
    * 
    * 
    * Creates an executor service that runs each task in the thread that invokes {@code
    * execute/submit}, as in {@link CallerRunsPolicy} This applies both to individually submitted
    * tasks and to collections of tasks submitted via {@code invokeAll} or {@code invokeAny}. In the
    * latter case, tasks will run serially on the calling thread. Tasks are run to completion before
    * a {@code Future} is returned to the caller (unless the executor has been shutdown).
    * 
    * <p>
    * Although all tasks are immediately executed in the thread that submitted the task, this
    * {@code ExecutorService} imposes a small locking overhead on each task submission in order to
    * implement shutdown and termination behavior.
    * 
    * <p>
    * The implementation deviates from the {@code ExecutorService} specification with regards to the
    * {@code shutdownNow} method. First, "best-effort" with regards to canceling running tasks is
    * implemented as "no-effort". No interrupts or other attempts are made to stop threads executing
    * tasks. Second, the returned list will always be empty, as any submitted task is considered to
    * have started execution. This applies also to tasks given to {@code invokeAll} or {@code
    * invokeAny} which are pending serial execution, even the subset of the tasks that have not yet
    * started execution. It is unclear from the {@code ExecutorService} specification if these
    * should be included, and it's much easier to implement the interpretation that they not be.
    * Finally, a call to {@code shutdown} or {@code shutdownNow} may result in concurrent calls to
    * {@code invokeAll/invokeAny} throwing RejectedExecutionException, although a subset of the
    * tasks may already have been executed.
