This is designed for interacting with a Joyent SmartOS host, in order to be able to leverage
the lightweight VM support (nee Solaris Zones).

It is planned to support KVM VMs in the future.

--------------

#Setup

Have a SmartOS installation, that you know either the root password for, or a secondary account with sufficient
permissions to be able to run the vm tools (vmadm, dsadm).

That's it!

#Notes:

- This is a work in progress, so please report any bugs that you find.
