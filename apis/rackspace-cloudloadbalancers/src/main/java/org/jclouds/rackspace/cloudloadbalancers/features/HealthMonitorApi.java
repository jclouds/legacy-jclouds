/**
 * The load balancing service includes a health monitoring operation which periodically checks your back-end nodes to 
 * ensure they are responding correctly. If a node is not responding, it is removed from rotation until the health 
 * monitor determines that the node is functional. In addition to being performed periodically, the health check also 
 * is performed against every node that is added to ensure that the node is operating properly before allowing it to 
 * service traffic. Only one health monitor is allowed to be enabled on a load balancer at a time.
 * </p>
 * As part of your strategy for monitoring connections, you should consider defining secondary nodes that provide 
 * failover for effectively routing traffic in case the primary node fails. This is an additional feature that will 
 * ensure you remain up in case your primary node fails.
