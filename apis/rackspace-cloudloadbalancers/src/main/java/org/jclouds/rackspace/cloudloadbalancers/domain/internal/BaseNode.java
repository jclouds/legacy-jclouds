/**
 * The nodes defined by the load balancer are responsible for servicing the requests received
 * through the load balancer's virtual IP. By default, the load balancer employs a basic health
 * check that ensures the node is listening on its defined port. The node is checked at the time of
 * addition and at regular intervals as defined by the load balancer health check configuration. If
 * a back-end node is not listening on its port or does not meet the conditions of the defined
 * active health check for the load balancer, then the load balancer will not forward connections
 * and its status will be listed as OFFLINE. Only nodes that are in an ONLINE status will receive
 * and be able to service traffic from the load balancer.
 * <p/>
 * All nodes have an associated status that indicates whether the node is ONLINE, OFFLINE, or
 * DRAINING. Only nodes that are in ONLINE status will receive and be able to service traffic from
 * the load balancer. The OFFLINE status represents a node that cannot accept or service traffic. A
 * node in DRAINING status represents a node that stops the traffic manager from sending any
 * additional new connections to the node, but honors established sessions. If the traffic manager
 * receives a request and session persistence requires that the node is used, the traffic manager
 * will use it. The status is determined by the passive or active health monitors.
 * <p/>
 * If the WEIGHTED_ROUND_ROBIN load balancer algorithm mode is selected, then the caller should
 * assign the relevant weights to the node as part of the weight attribute of the node element. When
 * the algorithm of the load balancer is changed to WEIGHTED_ROUND_ROBIN and the nodes do not
 * already have an assigned weight, the service will automatically set the weight to "1" for all
 * nodes.
