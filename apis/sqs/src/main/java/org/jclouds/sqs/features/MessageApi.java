    * The DeleteMessage action deletes the specified message from the specified

    * not the message ID you received when you sent the message. Even if the
    * message is locked by another reader due to the visibility timeout setting,
    * it is still deleted from the queue. If you leave a message in the queue
    * for more than 4 days, SQS automatically deletes it.
    * 
    * <h4>Note</h4>
    * 
    * The receipt handle is associated with a specific instance of receiving the
    * message. If you receive a message more than once, the receipt handle you
    * get each time you receive the message is different. When you request
    * DeleteMessage, if you don't provide the most recently received receipt
    * handle for the message, the request will still succeed, but the message
    * might not be deleted.
    * 
    * <h4>Important</h4>
    * 
    * It is possible you will receive a message even after you have deleted it.
    * This might happen on rare occasions if one of the servers storing a copy
    * of the message is unavailable when you request to delete the message. The
    * copy remains on the server and might be returned to you again on a
    * subsequent receive request. You should create your system to be idempotent
    * so that receiving a particular message more than once is not a problem.

    * The ChangeMessageVisibility action changes the visibility timeout of a

    * the timeout of a message in an existing queue to more than a total
    * visibility timeout of 12 hours. (For more information visibility timeout,
    * see Visibility Timeout in the Amazon SQS Developer Guide.)
    * 
    * For example, let's say the timeout for the queue is 30 seconds, and you
    * receive a message. Once you're 20 seconds into the timeout for that
    * message (i.e., you have 10 seconds left), you extend it by 60 seconds by
    * calling ChangeMessageVisibility with VisibilityTimeoutset to 60 seconds.
    * You have then changed the remaining visibility timeout from 10 seconds to
    * 60 seconds.
    * 
    * <h4>Important</h4>
    * 
    * If you attempt to set the VisibilityTimeout to an amount more than the
    * maximum time left, Amazon SQS returns an error. It will not automatically
    * recalculate and increase the timeout to the maximum time remaining.
    * 
    * <h4>Important</h4>
    * 
    * Unlike with a queue, when you change the visibility timeout for a specific
    * message, that timeout value is applied immediately but is not saved in
    * memory for that message. If you don't delete a message after it is
    * received, the visibility timeout for the message the next time it is
