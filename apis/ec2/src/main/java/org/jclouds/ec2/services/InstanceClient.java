   /**
    * Launches a specified number of instances of an AMI for which you have

    * <p/>
    * 
    * If Amazon EC2 cannot launch the minimum number AMIs you request, no
    * instances will be launched. If there is insufficient capacity to launch
    * the maximum number of AMIs you request, Amazon EC2 launches the minimum
    * number specified for each AMI and allocate the remaining available
    * instances using round robin.
    * <p/>
    * <h4>Security Groups</h4>
    * <b>Note:</b> Every instance is launched in a security group (created using
    * the CreateSecurityGroup operation.
    * <h4>Key Pair</h4>
    * You can provide an optional key pair ID for each image in the launch
    * request (created using the CreateKeyPair operation). All instances that
    * are created from images that use this key pair will have access to the
    * associated public key at boot. You can use this key to provide secure
    * access to an instance of an image on a per-instance basis. Amazon EC2
    * public images use this feature to provide secure access without passwords.
    * <p/>
    * <b>Note:</b> Launching public images without a key pair ID will leave them
    * inaccessible.
    * <p/>
    * The public key material is made available to the instance at boot time by
    * placing it in the openssh_id.pub file on a logical device that is exposed
    * to the instance as /dev/sda2 (the instance store). The format of this file
    * is suitable for use as an entry within ~/.ssh/authorized_keys (the OpenSSH
    * format). This can be done at boot (e.g., as part of rc.local) allowing for
    * secure access without passwords.
    * <h4>User Data</h4>
    * Optional user data can be provided in the launch request. All instances
    * that collectively comprise the launch request have access to this data.
    * For more information, go the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud Developer Guide.
    * <h4>Product Codes</h4>
    * 
    * <b>Note:</b> If any of the AMIs have a product code attached for which the
    * user has not subscribed, the RunInstances call will fail.
    * <h4>Kernel</h4>
    * 
    * <b>Important:</b> We strongly recommend using the 2.6.18 Xen stock kernel
    * with High-CPU and High-Memory instances. Although the default Amazon EC2
    * kernels will work, the new kernels provide greater stability and
    * performance for these instance types. For more information about kernels,
    * go the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud Developer Guide.
