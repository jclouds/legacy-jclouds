    * <h3>Note</h3> The maximum number of datapoints that the Amazon CloudWatch service will return
    * in a single GetMetricStatistics request is 1,440. If a request is made that would generate
    * more datapoints than this amount, Amazon CloudWatch will return an error. You can alter your
    * request by narrowing the time range (StartTime, EndTime) or increasing the Period in your
    * single request. You may also get all of the data at the granularity you originally asked for
    * by making multiple requests with adjacent time ranges.

    * @param namespace
    *           The namespace of the metric (e.g. AWS/EC2)
    * @param startTime
    *           The timestamp of the first datapoint to return, inclusive. We round your value down
    *           to the nearest minute. You can set your start time for more than two weeks in the
    *           past. However, you will only get data for the past two weeks.
    * @param endTime
    *           The timestamp to use for determining the last datapoint to return. This is the last
    *           datapoint to fetch, exclusive.
    * @param period
    *           The granularity (in seconds) of the returned datapoints.
    * @param statistics
    *           The statistics to be returned for the given metric. ex. Average
    * @param options
    *          more filtering options (e.g. instance ID)
